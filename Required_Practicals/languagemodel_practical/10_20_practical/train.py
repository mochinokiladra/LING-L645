    Implement a simple bigram language model and scorer
    First collect counts of unigrams and bigrams
    Then normalise each bigram by the frequency of the first unigram
    This is your bigram probability
    Store the output in a dict, e.g. model['want']['to'] = 0.023
    Save the dict to a file using pickle
    Now write a program that scores novel sentences based on the model
